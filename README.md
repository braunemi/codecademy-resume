Website of Codecademy accomplishments

My name is Emilio Braun, and I am a Grand Valley student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I found an interest in this field because of the feeling of power I get when I code and create cool things. I want to be able to work with others (in other words, I want to have clients) to help create awesome, responsive websites or any other software for the betterment of their work.
